<h1>1 Preamble</h1><p>
<p>
<hr>Abstract:
This package gives access to the database of Lie <i>p</i>-rings of order at most 
<i>p</i><sup>7</sup> as determined by Mike Newman, Eamonn O'Brien and Michael Vaughan-Lee, 
see <a href="biblio.htm#NOV04"><cite>NOV04</cite></a> and <a href="biblio.htm#OVL05"><cite>OVL05</cite></a>, and it provides some functionality to 
work with these Lie <i>p</i>-rings.

<hr>Acknowledgements:
The Lazard correspondence induces a one-to-one correspondence between the
Lie <i>p</i>-rings of order <i>p</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> and class less than <i>p</i> and the <i>p</i>-groups of 
order <i>p</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> and class less than <i>p</i>. This package provides a function to 
evaluate this correspondence; this function has been implemented and given
to us by Willem de Graaf.
