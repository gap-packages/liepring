\Chapter{Preamble}

{\bf Abstract:}
This package gives access to the database of Lie $p$-rings of order at most 
$p^7$ as determined by Mike Newman, Eamonn O'Brien and Michael Vaughan-Lee, 
see \cite{NOV04} and \cite{OVL05}, and it provides some functionality to 
work with these Lie $p$-rings.

{\bf Acknowlegdements:}
The Lazard correspondence induces a one-to-one correspondence between the
Lie $p$-rings of order $p^n$ and class less than $p$ and the $p$-groups of 
order $p^n$ and class less than $p$. This package provides a function to 
evaluate this correspondence; this function has been implemented and given
to us by Willem de Graaf.
